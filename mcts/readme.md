### The scripts for extracting minimal reaction substructures(MRS)
The users should install the `chemporop` package v1.7 to run the scrips.     
The demo of MRS extraction was shown in `mrs_extract.ipynb`. To run this script, you should extracting the 'trained_model.zip' in current file. Running `mrs_extract.ipynb` would show the extracted reaction substructures.  
You can try the MRS extraction of other reactions by inputting corresponding reaction SMILES.
