### The scripts for extracting minimal reaction substructures(MRS)
The users should install the `chemporop` package v1.7 so that these scrips can be run normally.     
The demo of MRS extraction was shown in `mrs_extract.ipynb`. Running this script would show the extracted reaction rationals.  
You can try the MRS extraction of other reactions by inputting corresponding reaction SMILES.
